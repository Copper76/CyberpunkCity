# Unity Shader Demo (Cyberpunk City)

This project is a demo project using Unity Engine. The project is a practice project where all the functions are implemented using shader language and particle system.
The demo is both a learning project for shader as well as a crude attempt to build a cyberpunk night scene with minimal support to recreate a scene in my cyberpunk campaign.
